#It is important to declare variables with 'const' so that I don't accidentally overwrite them and so that I don't polute global with too many variables

#If I use quotes such as "" or '', don't allow calls to variables in strings, `` does

#If I am to use express, I must load the express module using require() and assgign a variable for it

#I can use res.json() to convert a defined variable containing the code for the Json object I'm creating to a minified json object

#I'm slowly but surely picking up on the sytax for javascript. I'm using llms (grok is conversational and seems to make more intuitive leaps that GPT) to learn about new functions as i come across them

#Today is docker day! I'm going through the introductory lessons that docker has on their website. so far I've created some basic docker containers from a premade image on docker's repository. Additionally I've learned  some basic functions such as how to delete a container, update the code contained in the container and rebuild the updated container.

#I've also learned that I can start a repository on docker hub to share the containers I make and how to push them from vs code to the repository

#I've began learning about persistance with with docker containers. So far the trainings have talked about volumes, which will store data external to the docker container and allows for data to persist between iterations of the container, so long as they are pointed to the same file path.

#I've also began learning about the bind method of persistence with docker containers, which seems to be useful for continuous integration and integration, as it ties the docker container to the host file/file path and allows for the real time sync. I've also read up more on this and found that it allows for changes to be made from either side, which seems like it could be a potential vulerability for a secure system.
